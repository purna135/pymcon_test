PyMCon abides by the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct.

We value the participation of each member of the PyMC community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially sponsored by PyMC or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates, speakers, exhibitors and volunteers at PyMCon event are required to conform to the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

We reproduce here certain portions of the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct that are specifically relevant to PyMCon. We encourage all PyMCon participants to review the complete Code of Conduct.

# The Shorter Version

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes and language are not appropriate for PyMCon.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate.

PyMCon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

## How to Report

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, please report this in a timely manner. Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of the community for everyone and we take them seriously.

You can make a personal or anonymous report through any of the following channels:

Email: Send a message to any or all Diversity Chairs, who can be reached at oriol.abril.pla@gmail.com and andorra.alexandre@gmail.com. Event organizers will respond promptly.
Slack: Join the PyMCon Slack and contact the Diversity Chairs, Oriol Abril-Pla or Alex Andorra.
Online Form: A variant of the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Report is available for PyMCon here (your name and contact information are not required).
During PyMCon, we recommend contacting via email or Slack so we can take immediate action if necessary. In addition to contacting directly the Diversity committee, we also encourage you to make a report using our reporting form.

To file a report anonymously please use the online form

## What to include in a report

Our ability to address any Code of Conduct breaches in a timely and effective manner is impacted by the amount of information you can provide, so our reporting form asks you to include as much of the following information as you can:
