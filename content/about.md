# Video presentations

The heart of PyMCon are its video presentations. The speakers have all prerecorded their presentations to be published on October 24th. PyMCon videos are available for everyone without any registration required.

There are three presentation formats:

## Talks
30-40 min video about tricks, best practices, related library, etc.
## Tutorials
60 min video + engaging exercises diving into a topic.
## Let's build a model
45 min to 120 min video documenting how to build an example model using PyMC or associated library such as Bambi.

# Asynchronous discussion

In order to ease the interaction with the speakers and encourage discussion on the different talk topics, each talk has its own post on PyMC Discourse.

PyMCon is an async first conference. Not being able to attend the live session on the 31st does not prevent accessing the talks nor interacting with the speakers.

# Beginner zone

If you’re brand new to Bayesian statistics, have questions, but not sure where to start, the Beginner zone is the place. Specifically, it's a mailing list like chat channel in the PyMCon 2020 Zulip organization where seasoned Bayesians will be available to help folks out.

It’ll be active from October 24th to November 7th. If you’re interested please register using the form below and you’ll get an invite shortly.

Register for the beginner zone!
# Discourse networking

Starting October 24th, PyMC Discourse is not only a place for PyMC related questions. Our sponsors and community partners will also have topics dedicated to them where attendees to PyMCon's async format can network and interact with them.

Join Discourse!

# Diversity and Inclusion at PyMCon

Our commitment to the PyMC community is to create an inclusive and respectful conference environment that invites participation of people from all backgrounds, including, but not limited to gender, age, ethnicity, religion, accessibility and sexual orientation.

D&I touches every aspect of the conference, and we have various initiatives to promote diversity and inclusivity at PyMCon. Here are some examples at different levels:

# PyMCon organization

## Attendees

Share and participate in the various ways: ask questions, volunteer, attend, contribute to the sprint
Share our information with affinity groups
Contact us with any need we may have missed. You'll find us on Zulip ready to help
Share suggestions with us. We have a suggestion box just for that
Fill our PyMCon attendee survey. It will help us better understand and dedicate our efforts where they are most needed.
Everyone

Follow our code of conduct and communicate any issues
Use inclusive language (Inclusive language, Hey Guys)
PacMan Rule: include others in discussion, leave space open in circle for others to join. We believe Zulip's streams and topics provide a great platform for that by allowing everyone in a stream to receive the messages while keeping them together and opt out in topics.
